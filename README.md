# Download

Downloads of the project can be found at the [Releases](https://github.com/AnubiArts/anubicons/releases) tab at the side, v1 through v4 were released on Itch.io only initially, which is why they aren't documented for the patch notes here, but each release will have its patch notes from Itch.io linked in.

# Contributing

The best way to contribute is to make [Issues](https://github.com/AnubiArts/anubicons/issues) asking for an App/Game/Generic Icon, while doing so you should include the following information:

- Name of the App/Game / Description of the Generic Icon
- An example of how the Icon looks like (If possible, provide the most up-to-date example.)

After doing so, I'll get to work on it when I'm able to. Keep in mind that there's some Icons I won't draw, which are the following:
- Brave, Gimp, Apps/Websites focused on AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot...) or Crypto (OpenSea, Binance...)

You don't have a Github account? Please ask for them in other places if that's the case, I'll make sure to add them into the Issues.

Another way to support this project is via donations! my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/anubiarts) will always be open for those.
